# Hello! I'm Vitor Almeida ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a chemist pursuing my Ph.D. at the **Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de ValÃ¨ncia (UPV)**, focusing on **photocatalysis** using **MOFs (Metal-Organic Frameworks)** as catalysts. My research revolves around **CO2 photoreduction** reactions and **water splitting**.

## Skills and Interests
- **Photocatalysis and MOFs**
- **CO2 Photoreduction and Water Splitting Reactions**
- **Python programming** in my free time
- Data analysis, creating plots, and processing scientific data

## Projects and Experience
Throughout my Ph.D., I have developed research in advanced chemical reactions and photocatalysis. I also study programming, applying **Python** to simplify data analysis and visualization for scientific techniques like spectra and graphs.

## Goals
I continuously learn to integrate **programming and data analysis** tools into my daily work. I aim to enhance my **Python** skills to process lab data and generate graphs that speed up experiment analysis.
